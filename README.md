# Overview

I decided to learn Rust. So I did. This basic number guessing game shows some of the basic and unique components of the Rust Language. 

The game is split into 3 major parts; first, the definition of the class that will handle tha guessing; second, the definition using similar methods of the player class (these class objects are called struct in rust); and third, the game logic which has a few loops allowing the game to proceed as it should. This will guide the user through the terminal game. 

I think Rust is a powerful language that is just as fast and strong as C and is fairly easy to grasp as well. I figured it is already a well known and used language and so I decided it was high time I learned the basics.  


# Development Environment

# Future Work

- I'd like the number to have less influence over the player's score. 
- Make the score change appropriately for the player. 
- The loops are a bit wonky, so I'll maybe redo them. 
- Add a level system that will allow player to get hints at higher levels.
